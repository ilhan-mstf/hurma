SNMP Agent and Network Simulator


This is senior project of three computer engineer studies at Middle East Technical University. This project is network simulator and it creates virtual network environment and IP devices to test them. User configures the network environment after that simulation runs at server and user can see the alarms of devices. The software product name is Hurma which is a SNMP Agent and Network Simulator. It will be a web-based application and can be accessed from any browser.


We are implementing Hurma in JAVA with using Google Web Toolkit which is a powerful AJAX framework. There is a demo of our product that runs on Google AppEngine and you can find address at links section. For subversion hosting we chose to use Google Code which provides free svn repository and we upload our source codes here. Furthermore in Google Code there is issue tracking tool.
